# corepack
A better messagepack implementation for serde

To use:
```toml
corepack = "~0.4.0"
```

If you want to use corepack in a `no_std` environment (nightly rust required),
disable the "std" feature and enable the "alloc" feature:

```toml
corepack = { version = "~0.4.0", default-features = false, features = ["alloc"] }
```

You _must_ choose either "std" or "alloc" as a feature. Corepack currently
requires dynamic allocations in a few situations.
